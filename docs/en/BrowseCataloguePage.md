## Browse Catalogue page user guide

To create a page allowing users to browse Dublin Core or ISO records in a catalogue, follow these steps...

* Log in the SilverStripe CMS
* Choose Pages
* Click Add new
* Choose Browse Catalogue Page
* Click create
* Enter the normal SilverStripe page information such as Page name and Content
* Choose the Catalogue tab
* Enter the url to the catalogue CSW API endpoint
* Choose the format of records in that catalogue. Either ISO or Dublin Core.
* Save and publish the page.
* Optionally you can add a help box to the page by going to the Help and Add tab and entering a title and message.
* Optionally you can enter a link to an add page by filling out the Add box title and message and also selecting the page to link to.

The help and add boxes appear on the right of the page in a sidebar.

The details page functionality is part of the browse page so does not require any additional pages to be created in the CMS.
